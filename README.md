SilverStripe / Full-Stack / Responsive Test:

Create a 3 page responsive website based on the TV show The Muppets (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muppets).

Setup a basic layout showcasing front-end skills, nothing too fancy required, we're not testing design skills here but make it look nice.

Home Page - Some text, pull in a random character from the characters page (see below) and feature them on the homepage.

Characters Page - List as many characters from the show as you like. Name, Type & photo that when clicked load their full details with description via Ajax somehow.

Contact Page - Include a contact form that implements reCAPTCHA.
